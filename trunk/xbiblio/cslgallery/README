This is the start of a web application to create and 
distribute CSL styles. It's developed against the 
Django SVN trunk (which is probably required), using 
Python 2.5.

To get it running, modify the setup.example.py file 
as appropriate, and then run:

	python manage.py syncdb

This will create the database tables and allow you to 
set the admin user and password. Then do:

        python manage.py runserver


... and point your browser to:

	http://127.0.0.1:8000/

... to see the bare-bones of the interface. For something 
currently more interesting, go to:

	http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

... and log in.
